\title{Normalize the data with respect to indicator polarity}
\usage{
normalization(x, polarity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame of input values where rows are observations and columns are indicators.}

\item{polarity}{A vector of column indices indicating the positive polarity of indicators (optional).
If not provided, all indicators will be treated as having negative polarity.}
}
\value{
A data frame where the values have been normalized between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
This function normalizes the columns of a data frame based on the polarity of the indicators.
Positive polarity (e.g., variables where higher values are better) is normalized using the \code{norm_maxmin} method,
while negative polarity (e.g., variables where lower values are better) is normalized using \code{norm_minmax}.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: All indicators with negative polarity
data <- data.frame(
  indicator1 = c(10, 20, 30),
  indicator2 = c(5, 25, 35),
  indicator3 = c(50, 10, 0)
)
normalization(data)

# Example 2: Positive and negative polarity
# Suppose indicator1 and indicator3 have positive polarity (i.e., higher is better),
# and indicator2 has negative polarity (i.e., lower is better).
polarity_vector <- c(1, 3)
normalization(data, polarity = polarity_vector)

# Example 3: Custom data with both positive and negative polarities
custom_data <- data.frame(
  GDP = c(50000, 60000, 70000),
  Unemployment = c(10, 8, 6),
  Literacy = c(0.9, 0.85, 0.95)
)
# Assume GDP and Literacy are positive polarity indicators, Unemployment is negative
normalization(custom_data, polarity = c(1, 3))
}
