# FuzzyMetrics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This study aims at developing a new methodological approach for building composite indicators, focusing
on the weight schemes through an unsupervised machine learning technique. The composite indicator
proposed is based on fuzzy metrics to capture multidimensional concepts that do not have boundaries, such as competitiveness, development, corruption or vulnerability. This methodology is designed for formative measurement models using a set of indicators measured on different scales (quantitative, ordinal and binary) and it is partially compensatory. Under a benchmarking approach, the single indicators are synthesized.
The optimization method applied manages to remove the overlapping information provided for the single
indicators, so that the composite indicator provides a more realistic and faithful approximation to the concept
which would be studied. It has been quantitatively and qualitatively validated with a set of randomized
databases covering extreme and usual cases.

## Installation

You can install the development version of FuzzyMetrics like so:

``` r
# install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("E-Jimenez-Fernandez/Fuzzy-Metrics")

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to  Compute fuzzy composite indicators with randomly generated data

```{r example}
library(FuzzyMetrics)
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
large_data <- as.data.frame(matrix(runif(1000), nrow =100, ncol = 10))  # 100 rows, 10 columns
polarity <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)  # Assume some indicators have positive polarity
err_tolerance <- 0.001  # Error tolerance for stopping criteria
max_iterations <- 10  # Maximum iterations
degree_of_interaction <- 1  # Degree of interaction for MARS model
result <- CompFuzzy(large_data, polarity, err_tolerance, max_iterations, degree_of_interaction)
print(result$Fuzzydistance)  # Final fuzzy distance
print(result$iteration)  # Number of iterations executed

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
